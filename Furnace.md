**HOW TO PLAY : FURNACE**

A Furnace allows you to change items by firing them. For example, you can smelt Iron Ore into Iron Ingots in the Furnace.

Place the Furnace in the world and press LEFT_TRIGGER to use it.

You need to put some fuel into the bottom of the furnace, and the item to be fired in the top. The furnace will then fire up and start working.

When your items have been fired, you can move them from the output area into your inventory.

If an item your inventory pointer is over is an ingredient or fuel for the furnace, you can quick move it to the correct slot by pressing BUTTON_Y.
