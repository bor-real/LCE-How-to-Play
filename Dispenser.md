**HOW TO PLAY : DISPENSER**

A Dispenser is used to shoot out items. You will need to place a switch (for example, a lever) next to the dispenser to trigger it.

To fill the dispenser with items press LEFT_TRIGGER, then move the items that you want to dispense from your inventory to your dispenser.

Now whenever you use the switch, the dispenser will shoot out an item.
