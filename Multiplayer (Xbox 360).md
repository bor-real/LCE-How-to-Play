**HOW TO PLAY : MULTIPLAYER

Minecraft on the Xbox 360 console is a multiplayer game by default. If you are playing in a High Definition mode, you can have local players join your game by attaching controllers and pressing START_BUTTON at any point during the game.

When you start or join an online game it will be visible to people in your friends list (unless you've selected Invite Only when hosting the game), and if they join the game, it will also be visible to people in their friends list (if you have selected the Allow Friends of Friends option).

When you are in a game, you can press the BACK_BUTTON button to bring up a list of all other players in the game, view their Gamer Cards, Kick players from the game, and invite others to the game.
