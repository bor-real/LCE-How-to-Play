**HOW TO PLAY : GLIDE MINI GAME**

Glide is a fast paced Elytra Mini Game. There are 2 variants:
**Score Attack:**
Fly through score rings to gain points. The player with the most points is the winner, but you still have to rach the end for your score to count.
**Time Attack:**
Speed is of the essence! The player who reaches the end in the fastest time is the winner

**Lobby**
At the start of the game, the players are placed in a lobby area while other players are joining the game. Once there are a minimum number of players in a lobby, a timer will start; although if all players press X_BUTTON to declare themselves ready, the game will start immediately.

**Gameplay - General**
Glide is all about flying without power; you can gain speed by diving, but you'll stall if you climb too steeply.
In glide you will find Thermals and Speed Boosts. There are 2 types of each:

**Thermals**
Fixed (White): These lift you up to a set height.
Natural (Blue): These lift you up based on your speed and angle; the longer you stay in a Natural Thermal, the more height you will gain.

**Speed Boosts**
Directional (Yellow): These boost you in the direction the arrows point.
Omni (Orange): These boost you in the direction that you are facing on entering.

**Gameplay - Score Attack**
In Score Attack the goal is to score as many points as possible by flying through rings. You still have to reach the end for your score to count.

Green Rings = 3 Points.
Yellow Rings = 5 Points.
Blue Rings = 7 Points.

The player who crosses the finish line with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the fastest time wins.

**Gameplay - Time Attack**
In Time Attack, the goal is simply to reach the end as quickly as possible. The player with the single fastest time in any of the three rounds is declared the winner!
