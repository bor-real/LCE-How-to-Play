**HOW TO PLAY : TUMBLE MINI GAME**

Tumble is a fast paced last-man-standing mini game, where players try to destroy the blocks beneath the other players, causing them to fall into lava. The last player alive in the level is the winner.

**Gameplay**
At the start of the game, the players are placed in a lobby area while other players are joining the game. Once there are a minimum number of players in a lobby, a timer will start; although if all players press X_BUTTON to declare themselves ready, the game will start immediately.
Once the players enter the first arena, the game begins.
Each round lasts a set time, or until there is only one surviving player. The game will then progress to the next arena, and all of the dead players will respawn.
Once a single player has won 3 rounds, players will be returned to the lobby.

**Spectating**
When a player dies, they will be able to watch the action as a spectator; either by following a surviving player, or by flying around the arena as a Bat, Parrot, Vex, or floating head!

**Game State**
At the end of a game, there will be a scoreboard showing the statistics for that game.
Players will be awarded medals for their achievements (or lack of achievements) in the game.
