HOW TO PLAY : CHEST

Once you have crafted a Chest, you can place it in the world and open it with RIGHT_TRIGGER to store items from your inventory.

Use the pointer to move items between your inventory and the chest.

Items in the chest will be stored there for you to swap back into your inventory again later.
