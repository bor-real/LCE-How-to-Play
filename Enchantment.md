**HOW TO PLAY : ENCHANTING**

The Experience Points collected by picking up Experience Orb can be used to enchant Swords, Bows, Axes, Pickaxes, Shovels, Armor and books.
When an Enchantable item is placed in the slot below the book in the Enchantment Table, the three buttons to the right of the slot will display some enchantments with their Experience Level cost and Lapis Lazuli cost.
If you do not have enough Experience Levels or have not provided enough Lapis Lazuli to use some of these, the releveant cost will appear in red; otherwise it will be shown in green.

The actual enchantment applied is randomly selected based on the cost displayed.

If the Enchantment Table is surrounded by Bookshelves (up to a maximum of 15), with a one block gap between the Bookcase and Enchantment Table, arcane glyphs will be seen coming from the book on the Enchantment Table and the potency of the enchantments will be increased.

All of the ingredients for an Enchantment Table can be found within the villages in a world, or by minig and cultivation of the world.

Enchantment Books are used at the Anvil to apply enchantments to items. This gives you more control over which enchantments you would like on your items.
