**HOW TO PLAY : INVENTORY**

Press Y_BUTTON to view your inventory.

This screen shows the items that are available for use in your hand, and all of the other items you are carrying. Your armor is also shown here.

Use LEFT_STICK to move the pointer. Use A_BUTTON to pick up the item that is under the pointer. If there is more than one item here this will pick them all up, or you can use X_BUTTON to pick up just half of them.

You can place items down again by using A_BUTTON. WIth multiple items on the pointer, use A_BUTTON to place them all or X_BUTTON to place just one.

If the item you are pointing at is armor, you can quick move it to the correct armor slot by pressing Y_BUTTON.

It is possible to change the color of Leather Armor by dyeing it. You can do this in the inventory menu by picking up the dye you want to use, then pressing X_BUTTON while the pointer is over the piece of armor you want to dye.
