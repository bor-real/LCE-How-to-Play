**HOW TO PLAY : BREWING**

Brewing potions requires a Brewing Stand, which can be built at a crafint table. Every potion starts off with a bottle of water, which is made by filling a Glass Bottle with water from a Cauldron or water source.
A Brewing Stand has three slots for bottles, so can be used to make three potions at the time same time. One ingredient can be used over all three bottles, so always brew three potions at the same to best use your resources.
Brewing Stands need fuel, so you'll need to acquire some Blaze Powder too.
Putting a potion ingredient in the top position of the Brewing Stand will make a base potion after a short time. This doesn't have any effect by itself, but brewing another ingredient into this base potion will give you a potion with an effect.
Once you have this potion you can add a third ingredient to make the effect last longer (using Redstone Dust), be more intense (using Glowstone Dust), or turn into a harmful potion (using a Fermented Spider Eye).
You can also add gunpowder to any potion to turn it into a Splash Potion, which can be thrown. The thrown Splash Potion will cause the potion effect to be applied over the entire area that it lands in.
By adding Dragon's Breath to a Splash Potion, you can make a Lingering Potion which leaves a gas cloud on the ground when thrown. Anything walking into this cloud will have the potion's effect applied to it.
