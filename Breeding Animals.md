**HOW TO PLAY : BREEDING ANIMALS**

The animals in Minecraft can breed, and will produce baby versions of themselves! To get animals to breed, you will need to feed them with the right food to get them to go into 'Love Mode'.
Feed Wheat to a cow, mooshroom, or sheep; Carrots or Beetroot to a pig; any kind of Seeds to a chicken; Carrots, Golden Carrots, or Dandelions to a rabbit; uncooked fish of any kind to an ocelot; or any kind of meat to a wolf; and they'll start looking for another nearby animal of the same species that is also in Love Mode.
When two animals of the same species meet, and both are in Love Mode, they will kiss for a few seconds - then a baby animal will appear. The baby animal will follow their parents for a while before growing into a full sized animal itself.
After breeding, an animal won't be able to enter Love Mode again for about five minutes.
There is a limit to the number of animals it is possible to have in a world, so you may find that animals don't breed when you have a lot of them.
