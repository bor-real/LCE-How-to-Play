**HOW TO PLAY : BATTLE MINI GAME**

Battle is a frantice last-man-standing fight to the death, where players will have to scavenge the arenas for chest containing weapons, armor, and food in order to survive and to have an advantage over other players.
The last player alive, or the player with the most kills when the level time ends, is the winner!

**Gameplay**
At the start of the game, the players are placed in a lobby area while other players are joining the game. Once there are a minimum number of players in a lobby, a timer will start; although if all players press X_BUTTON to declare themselves ready, the game will start immediately.
Once the players enter the first arena, they will be locked to a podium position while everyone is loading and a timer will count down to the start of the game. Once the timer runs out, the players are released from their podiums, but will be invulnerable for a short amount of time to allow them to find a weapon.
After the grace period, the battle begins!
Each round lasts a set time, or until there is only one surviving player. The game will then progress to the next arena, and all of the dead players will respawn.

**Restrictions**
In Battle, players are not able to build or mine; it's all about finding the weapons, armor, and food needed to survive!

**Spectating**
When a player dies, they will be able to watch the action as a spectator; either by following a surviving player, or by flying around the arena as a Bat, Parrot, Vex, or floating head!

**Match Reports**
At the end of a round, there will be a match report showing the statistics for the round.
Players will be awarded metals for their achievements (or lack of achievments) in the round.
