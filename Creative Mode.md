**HOW TO PLAY : CREATIVE MODE**

The creative mode interface allows any item in the game to be moved into the player's inventory without the need for mining or crafting the item.
The items in the player's inventory will not be removed when they are placed or used in the world. This allows the player to focus on building rather than resource gathering.
If you create, load, or save a world in Creative Mode that world will have achievements disabled, even if it is later loaded in Survival Mode.
When in Creative Mode, to fly quickly tap A_BUTTON twice. To fly faster, quickly tap LEFT_STICK forward twice. To stop flying, double tap A_BUTTON again.
When flying, you can hold down A_BUTTON to ascend and RIGHT_STICK_BUTTON to descend; or use DPAD_UP to move up, DPAD_DOWN to move down, DPAD_LEFT to move left, and DPAD_RIGHT to move right.
