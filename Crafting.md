**HOW TO PLAY : CRAFTING**

In the crafting interface, you can combine items from your inventory to create new types of items. Use X_BUTTON to open the crafting interface.

Scroll through the tabs at the tob using LEFT_BUMPER and RIGHT_BUMPER to select the type of item you wish to craft, then use LEFT_STICK to select the item to craft.

The crafting area shows the items required to craft the new item. Press A_BUTTON to craft the item and place it in your inventory.

Scroll through the tabs on the left using LEFT_TRIGGER and RIGHT_TRIGGER to switch between regular crafting, Banner crafting, and Firework crafting.

You can also use 'Classic Crafting' interface by enabling the option in the Settings/User Interface menu. This will disable the automatic crafting of items, and instead use the method found in the Java version of Minecraft where you have to manually place ingredients in the right pattern in the grid to produce the item you want. More information on the patterns required is available on the Minecraft wiki page.
